For the poster analysis exercise, I examined the posters for Enter the Void (directed by Gaspar Noe) and Amen (Costa-Gavras). 
I thought the Enter the Void poster offered an interesting take on perspective with unusual angles and psychedlic color scheme.
Similarly, Amen incorporated a Swastika into the movie poster that also mimics a cross, in line with the movie's theme (the Holocaust and the Catholic church).
In terms of my images, I chose the symbols of red curtains, 60's themed flower patterns and silhouettes. I'm not sure yet which direction I'll go in, just experimenting with colors and patterns from the film.
